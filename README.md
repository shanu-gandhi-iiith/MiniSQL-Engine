# MiniSQL-Engine
A mini​ sql engine which will run a subset of SQL Queries using ​ command line interface.
Dataset:
1. CSV files for tables.
  a. If a file is : ​ File1.csv ​ , the table name would be File1.
  b. There will be no tab ​ separation or space ​ separation, so you are not required t e
     handle it but you have to make sure to take care of both csv file type cases: the
     one where values are in double quotes and the one where values are without
     quotes.
2. All the elements in files would be ​ only ​ INTEGERS​​ .
3. A file named: ​ metadata.txt ​ (note the extension) would be given to you which will
    have the following structure for each table:
    <begin_table>
    <table_name>
    <attribute1>
    ....
    <attributeN>
    <end_table>
  
 
Types of Queries:
1. Select all records:
Example Query: Select * from table_name;
2. Aggregate functions: Simple aggregate functions on a single column namely - ​ Sum,
average, max and min​ .
Example Query: Select max(col1) from table1;
3. Project Columns (could be any number of columns) from one or more tables:
Example Query: Select col1, col2 from table_name;
4. Select/project with distinct (for only one attribute) from one table.
Example Query: Select distinct(col1) from table_name;
5. Select with where from one or more tables :
  a. In the where queries, there would be a maximum of one AND/OR operator
    with no NOT operators.
  b. Relational operators that are to be handled in the assignment, the operators
    include "<, >, <=, >=, =".
  Example Query: Select col1,col2 from table1,table2 where col1=10 AND col2=20;
6. Projection of one or more(including all the columns) from two tables with one join
  condition :
  a. NO REPETITION OF COLUMNS – THE JOINING COLUMN SHOULD BE
    PRINTED ONLY ONCE.
     Example Query1: Select * from table1, table2 where table1.col1=table2.col2;
     Example Query2: Select col1,col2 from table1,table2 where
      table1.col1=table2.col2 AND table2.col2>=10.

Input Format:
It will be – python engine.py “select * from table_name where condition”

Output format:
<Table1.column1, Table1.column2....TableN.columnM>
Row1
Row2
.......
RowN
